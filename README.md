# Purpose
- Learning the Rust programming language, as it's wildly different to the languages I currently know. It also has a unique borrowing/ownership model.
- Learning how to do common tasks in Rust and grasping the basics before moving on to other more advanced resources.

# What's next
- Having a look at other resources like:
  - The Rust Programming Language book: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/
  - Rust By Example course and exercises: https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/rust-by-example/
